(s7 description "s7 is a Scheme implementation intended as an extension language for other applications, primarily Snd, Radium, Common Music, and Max/MSP through the Scheme For Max external. It exists as just two files, s7.c and s7.h, that want only to disappear into someone else's source tree. There are no libraries, no run-time init files, and no configuration scripts. It can be built as a stand-alone interpreter")
