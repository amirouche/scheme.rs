(kawa description "Kawa is a general-purpose programming language that runs on the Java platform. It aims to combine: a) the benefits of dynamic scripting languages (non-verbose code with less boiler-plate, fast and easy start-up, a REPL, no required compilation step); with b)the benefits of traditional compiled languages (fast execution, static error detection, modularity, zero-overhead Java platform integration). It is an extension of the long-established Scheme language, which is in the Lisp family of programming languages. Kawa has many useful features. Kawa is also a useful framework for implementing other programming languages on the Java platform. It has many useful utility classes.")
