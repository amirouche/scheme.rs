      <div><h1>A cheatsheet on Discourse.</h1>
<h2>The three gates of speech</h2>
<p>Before you speak, let your words pass through three gates.</p>
<ul>
<li>At the first gate, ask yourself, is it true.</li>
<li>At the second gate ask, is it necessary.</li>
<li>At the third gate ask, is it kind.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Rogerian rhetoric</h2>
<blockquote><ol>
<li><p>You should attempt to re-express your target's position so
clearly, vividly, and fairly that your target says, "Thanks, I
wish I'd thought of putting it that way."</p>
</li>
<li><p>You should list any points of agreement (especially if they are
not matters of general or widespread agreement).</p>
</li>
<li><p>You should mention anything you have learned from your target.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Only then are you permitted to say so much as a word of rebuttal
or criticism.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<h2>Argument Ranking</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>●●●●● - High-level generators - Disagreements that remain when
everyone understands exactly what's being argued, and agrees on what
all the evidence says, but have vague and hard-to-define reasons for
disagreeing.</p>
</li>
<li><p>●●●●○ - Operationalizing - Where both parties understand they're in
a cooperative effort to fix exactly what they're arguing about.</p>
</li>
<li><p>●●●○○ - Survey of evidence - Not trying to devastate the other
person with a mountain of facts and start looking at the studies and
arguments on both sides and figuring out what kind of complex
picture they paint.</p>
</li>
<li><p>●●●○○ - Disputing definitions - Argument hinges on the meaning of words, or
whether something counts as a member of a category or not.</p>
</li>
<li><p>●●○○○ - Single Studies - Better than scattered facts, proving they at least
looked into the issue formally.</p>
</li>
<li><p>●●○○○ - Demands for rigor - Attempts to demand that an opposing argument be held
to such strict standards that nothing could possibly clear the bar.</p>
</li>
<li><p>●○○○○ - Single Facts- One fact, which admittedly does support their argument,
but presented as if it solves the debate in and of itself.</p>
</li>
<li><p>●○○○○ - Gotchas - Short claims that purport to be devastating proof that one
side can't possibly be right.</p>
</li>
<li><p>○○○○○ - Social shaming- A demand for listeners to place someone outside the
boundary of whom deserve to be heard.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Arguments</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ad baculum</strong> : Argument relying on an appeal to fear or a threat.</li>
<li><strong>Ad ignorantiam</strong> : Argument relying on people's ignorance.</li>
<li><strong>Ad populum</strong> : Argument relying on sentimental weakness.</li>
<li><strong>Ad verecundiam</strong> : Argument relying on the the words of an "expert", or authority.</li>
<li><strong>Ex silentio</strong> : Argument relying on ignorance.</li>
<li><strong>Ex nihilo</strong> : An argument that bears no relation to the previous topic of discussion.</li>
<li><strong>Non sequitur</strong> : An inference that does not follow from established premises or evidence.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Responses</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Akrasia</strong> : State of acting against one's better judgment.</li>
<li><strong>Connotation</strong> : Emotional association with a word.</li>
<li><strong>Intransigence</strong> : Refusal to change one's views or to agree about something.</li>
<li><strong>Inferential distance</strong> : Gap between the background knowledge and epistemology of a person trying to explain an idea, and the background knowledge and epistemology of the person trying to understand it.</li>
<li><strong>Straw man</strong> : Creating a false or made up scenario and then attacking it. Painting your opponent with false colors only deflects the purpose of the argument.</li>
<li><strong>Steel man</strong> : To steelman is to address the strongest possible variant or the most charitable interpretation of an idea, rather than the most available phrasings.</li>
<li><strong>Red herring</strong> : A diversion from the active topic.</li>
<li><strong>Rationalization</strong> : Starts from a conclusion, and then works backward to arrive at arguments apparently favouring that conclusion. Rationalization argues for a side already selected.</li>
<li><strong>Dogpiling</strong> : A disagreement wherein one person says something wrong or offensive, and a large number of people comment in response to tell them how wrong they are, and continue to disparage the original commenter beyond any reasonable time limit.</li>
<li><strong>Grandstanding</strong> : An action that is intended to make people notice and admire you, behaving in a way that makes people pay attention to you instead of thinking about more important matters.</li>
<li><strong>Whataboutism</strong> : An attempt to discredit an opponent's position by charging them with hypocrisy without directly refuting or disproving their argument.</li>
<li><strong>Dissensus</strong> : The deliberate avoidance of consensus.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Beliefs</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Belief</strong> : The mental state in which an individual holds a
proposition to be true.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Priors</strong> : The beliefs an agent holds regarding a fact, hypothesis
or consequence, before being presented with evidence.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Alief</strong> : An independent source of emotional reaction which can
coexist with a contradictory belief. Example The fear felt when a
monster jumps out of the darkness in a scary movie is based on the
alief that the monster is about to attack you, even though you
believe that it cannot.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Proper belief</strong> : Requires observations, gets updated upon
encountering new evidence, and provides practical benefit in
anticipated experience.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Improper belief</strong> : Is a belief that isn't concerned with
describing the territory. Note that the fact that a belief just
happens to be true doesn't mean you're right to have it. If you buy
a lottery ticket, certain that it's a winning ticket (for no
reason), and it happens to be, believing that was still a mistake.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Belief in belief</strong> : Where it is difficult to believe a thing, it
is often much easier to believe that you ought to believe it. Were
you to really believe and not just believe in belief, the
consequences of error would be much more severe. When someone makes
up excuses in advance, it would seem to require that belief, and
belief in belief, have become unsynchronized.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>A Priori</strong> : Knowledge which we can be sure of without any
empirical evidence(evidence from our senses). So, knowledge that you
could realize if you were just a mind floating in a void unconnected
to a body.</p>
</li>
</ul>

done, their aim fulfilled, people will say: we did it ourselves."</p>

<p>The first principle of Wikipedia etiquette has been said to be
<strong>Assume Good Faith</strong>, also they <strong>Be Bold, but not Reckless</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Wrong discourse</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Answer: Jumping into a conversation with endless unapplicable,
unrealistic or unrelated answers to the question.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Question: Spouting accusations while cowardly hiding behind the
claim of just asking questions, and ignoring the answers. Asking
loaded questions.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Good discourse</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Answer: A clear and honest response to the central point of a question
without an aggressive attempt to convince.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Question: question asked with the intention to be fair, open, and
honest, regardless of the outcome of the interaction.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Social rules are expected to be broken from time to time, in that
regard they are different from a code of conduct.</p>
<h3>Response Ranking</h3>
<ul>
<li>●●●●●● - Central point - Commit to refute explicitly the central point.</li>
<li>●●●●●○ - Refutation - Argue a conflicting passage, explain why it's mistaken.</li>

<li>●●●○○○ - Contradiction - State the opposing case, what.</li>
<li>●●○○○○ - Responding to Tone - Responding to the author's tone, how.</li>
<li>●○○○○○ - Ad Hominem - Attacking the author directly, who.</li>

a project.</p>
</li>
<li><p>●●●●○ - Update - Presenting the recent development of a personal experience,
ongoing event or work in progress.</p>
</li>
<li><p>●●●○○ - Soapbox - Spontaneous and or enthusiastic posts about a general topic of
interest or finding.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Low-Effort</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>●●○○○ - Rant- Venting frustration publicly without explicitly
looking to have a conversation about the matter.</p>
</li>
<li><p>●○○○○ - Shitpost - Aggressively or ironically looking for the
biggest reaction with the least effort possible. Includes subtoots
and vague-posting.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Emotional Reaction</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Seduction</strong> - You are led to feel that the fulfillment of your
dreams depends on your doing what the other is encouraging you to
do.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Alignment</strong> - The interests of the system are presented as
fulfilling your emotional needs. You are led to feel that your
survival, your viability in society or your very identity depends on
your doing what the other is requiring of you.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Reduction</strong> - Complex subjects are reduced to a single,
emotionally charged issue.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Polarization</strong> - Issues are presented in such a way that you are
either right or wrong. You are told that any dialogue between
different perspectives is suspect, dangerous or simply not
permissible.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Marginalization</strong> - You are made to feel that your own interests (or interests
that run counter to the interests of the other) are inconsequential.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Framing</strong> - The terms of a debate are set so that issues that threaten the system
cannot be articulated or discussed. You are led to ignore aspects of the issue
that may be vitally important to your own interests but are contrary to the
interests of the other that is seeking to make you act in their interests.</p>
</li>
</ul>
