Let's agree that *serif* fonts do not always carry boring stuff. And have a taste of it:

Otherwise said, Scheme offers a minimalist core of powerful primitives
upon which one can build abstractions to solve (real world) problems.

The Scheme universe is vast and prolific. As programming languages,
Scheme dialects target various niches and implement various
paradigms. Some of them are part of the de facto standards (namely
RnRS and SRFIs).

The best-known paradigm of agreed-upon practices revolve around
Functional Programming.

Scheme might be a dynamically typed language, but it can compete with
its scions and siblings when performance matters.

Few programming languages can compete with Scheme when it comes to
computer science whether it is Programming Language Theory, or
Artificial Intelligence.

That being said, Scheme implementations might be missing some
love. That's a good opportunity for you to learn something useful and
give something back.

Or, like others, to make it your secret sauce.
