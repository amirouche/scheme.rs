# `(scheme case-lambda)`

## `(case-lambda <clause1> ...)` syntax

Each clause is of the form `(<formals> <body>)`, where `<formals>` and
`<body>` have the same syntax as in a lambda expression.

A case-lambda expression evaluates to a procedure that accepts a
variable number of arguments and is lexically scoped in the same
manner as a procedure resulting from a lambda expression. When the
procedure is called, the first clause for which the arguments agree
with `<formals>` is selected, where agreement is specified as for the
`<formals>` of a lambda expression. The variables of `<formals>` are
bound to fresh locations, the values of the arguments are stored in
those locations, the `<body>` is evaluated in the extended
environment, and the results of `<body>` are returned as the results
of the procedure call.

It is an error for the arguments not to agree with the `<formals>` of
any clause`.

Example:

```scheme
(define add1
  (case-lambda
    ((a) (add1 a 0))
    ((a b) (+ 1 a b))))

(add1 1) ;; => 2
(add1 1 2) ;; => 4
```
