# `(scheme regex)`

This library is based on
[SRFI-115](https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-115/).

This library provides a library for matching strings with regular
expressions described using the SRE "Scheme Regular Expression"
notation first introduced by SCSH, and extended heavily by IrRegex.

## `(regexp re)`

Compiles a regexp if given an object whose structure matches the SRE
syntax. This may be written as a literal or partial literal with quote
or quasiquote, or may be generated entirely programmatically. Returns
re unmodified if it is already a regexp. Raises an error if re is
neither a regexp nor a valid representation of an SRE.

Mutating re may invalidate the resulting regexp, causing unspecified
results if subsequently used for matching.

## `(rx sre ...)`

Macro shorthand for (regexp `(: sre ...)). May be able to perform some
or all computation at compile time if sre is not unquoted. Note
because of this equivalence with the procedural constructor regexp,
the semantics of unquote differs from the original SCSH implementation
in that unquoted expressions can expand into any object matching the
SRE syntax, but not a compiled regexp object. Further, unquote and
unquote-splicing both expand all matches.

Rationale: Providing a procedural interface provides for greater
flexibility, and without loss of potential compile-time optimizations
by preserving the syntactic shorthand. The alternative is to rely on
eval to dynamically generate regular expressions. However regexps in
many cases come from untrusted sources, such as search parameters to a
server, or from serialized sources such as config files or
command-line arguments. Moreover many applications may want to keep
many thousands of regexps in memory at once. Given the relatively
heavy cost and insecurity of eval, and the frequency with which SREs
are read and written as text, we prefer the procedural interface.

## `(regexp->sre re)`

Returns an SRE corresponding to the given regexp re. The SRE will be
equivalent to (will match the same strings) but not necessarily equal?
to the SRE originally used to compile re. Mutating the result may
invalidate re, causing unspecified results if subsequently used for
matching.

## `(char-set->sre char-set)`

Returns an SRE corresponding to the given SRFI 14 character set. The
resulting SRE expands the character set into notation which does not
make use of embedded SRFI 14 character sets, and so is suitable for
writing portably.

## `(valid-sre? obj)`

Returns true iff obj can be safely passed to regexp.

## `(regexp? obj)`

Returns true iff obj is a regexp.

## `(regexp-matches re str [start [end]])`

Returns an regexp-match object if re successfully matches the entire
string str from start (inclusive) to end (exclusive), or #f is the
match fails. The regexp-match object will contain information needed
to extract any submatches.

## `(regexp-matches? re str [start [end]])`

Returns #t if re matches str as in regexp-matches, or #f
otherwise. May be faster than regexp-matches since it doesn't need to
return submatch data.

## `(regexp-search re str [start [end]])`

Returns a regexp-match object if re successfully matches a substring
of str between start (inclusive) and end (exclusive), or #f if the
match fails. The regexp-match object will contain information needed
to extract any submatches.

## `(regexp-fold re kons knil str [finish [start [end]]])`

The fundamental regexp matching iterator. Repeatedly searches str for
the regexp re so long as a match can be found. On each successful
match, applies (kons i regexp-match str acc) where i is the index
since the last match (beginning with start), regexp-match is the
resulting match, and acc is the result of the previous kons
application, beginning with knil. When no more matches can be found,
calls finish with the same arguments, except that regexp-match is #f.

By default finish just returns acc.

```scheme
   (regexp-fold 'word
                (lambda (i m str acc)
                  (let ((s (regexp-match-submatch m 0)))
                   (cond ((assoc s acc)
                          => (lambda (x) (set-cdr! x (+ 1 (cdr x))) acc))
                         (else `((,s . 1) ,@acc)))))
                '()
                "to be or not to be")
   => '(("not" . 1) ("or" . 1) ("be" . 2) ("to" . 2))
```

## `(regexp-extract re str [start [end]])`

Extracts all non-empty substrings of str which match re between start
and end as a list of strings.

```scheme
   (regexp-extract '(+ numeric) "192.168.0.1")
   => ("192" "168" "0" "1")
```

## `(regexp-split re str [start [end]])`

Splits str into a list of (possibly empty) strings separated by
non-empty matches of re.

```scheme
(regexp-split '(+ space) " fee fi  fo\tfum\n")
=> ("" "fee" "fi" "fo" "fum" "")
(regexp-split '(",;") "a,,b,")
=> ("a" "" "b" "")
(regexp-split '(* digit) "abc123def456ghi789")
=> ("abc" "def" "ghi" "")
```

## `(regexp-partition re str [start [end]])`

Partitions str into a list of non-empty strings matching re,
interspersed with the unmatched portions of the string. The first and
every odd element is an unmatched substring, which will be the empty
string if re matches at the beginning of the string or end of the
previous match. The second and every even element will be a substring
matching re. If the final match ends at the end of the string, no
trailing empty string will be included. Thus, in the degenerate case
where str is the empty string, the result is ("").

Note that regexp-partition is equivalent to interleaving the results
of regexp-split and regexp-extract, starting with the former.

```scheme
(regexp-partition '(+ (or space punct)) "")
=> ("")
(regexp-partition '(+ (or space punct)) "Hello, world!\n")
=> ("Hello" ", " "world" "!\n")
(regexp-partition '(+ (or space punct)) "¿Dónde Estás?")
=> ("" "¿" "Dónde" " " "Estás" "?")
(regexp-partition '(* digit) "abc123def456ghi789")
=> ("abc" "123" "def" "456" "ghi" "789")
```

## `(regexp-replace re str subst [start [end [count]])`

Returns a new string replacing the countth match of re in str the
subst, where the zero-indexed count defaults to zero (i.e. the first
match). If there are not count matches, returns the selected substring
unmodified.

subst can be a string, an integer or symbol indicating the contents of
a numbered or named submatch of re, 'pre for the substring to the left
of the match, or 'post for the substring to the right of the match.

The optional parameters start and end restrict both the matching and
the substitution, to the given indices, such that the result is
equivalent to omitting these parameters and replacing on (substring
str start end). As a convenience, a value of #f for end is equivalent
to (string-length str).

```scheme
(regexp-replace '(+ space) "one two three" "_")
=> "one_two three"
(regexp-replace '(+ space) "one two three" "_" 0 #f 0)
=> "one_two three"
(regexp-replace '(+ space) "one two three" "_" 0 #f 1)
=> "one two_three"
(regexp-replace '(+ space) "one two three" "_" 0 #f 2)
=> "one two three"
```

## `(regexp-replace-all re str subst [start [end]])`

Equivalent to regexp-replace, but replaces all occurrences of re in
str.

```
(regexp-replace-all '(+ space) "one two three" "_")
=> "one_two_three"
```

## `(regexp-match? obj)`

Returns true iff obj is a successful match from regexp-matches or
regexp-search.

```scheme
(regexp-match? (regexp-matches "x" "x"))  => #t
(regexp-match? (regexp-matches "x" "y"))  => #f
```

## `(regexp-match-count regexp-match)`

Returns the number of submatches of regexp-match, regardless of
whether they matched or not. Does not include the implicit zero full
match in the count.

```scheme
(regexp-match-count (regexp-matches "x" "x"))  => 0
(regexp-match-count (regexp-matches '($ "x") "x"))  => 1
```

## `(regexp-match-submatch regexp-match field)`

Returns the substring matched in regexp-match corresponding to field,
either an integer or a symbol for a named submatch. Index 0 refers to
the entire match, index 1 to the first lexicographic submatch, and so
on. If there are multiple submatches with the same name, the first
which matched is returned. If passed an integer outside the range of
matches, or a symbol which does not correspond to a named submatch of
the pattern, it is an error. If the corresponding submatch did not
match, returns false.

The result of extracting a submatch after the original matched string
has been mutated is unspecified.

```scheme
(regexp-match-submatch (regexp-search 'word "**foo**") 0)  => "foo"
(regexp-match-submatch
  (regexp-search '(: "*" ($ word) "*") "**foo**") 0)  => "*foo*"
(regexp-match-submatch
  (regexp-search '(: "*" ($ word) "*") "**foo**") 1)  => "foo"
```

## `(regexp-match-submatch-start regexp-match field)`

Returns the start index regexp-match corresponding to field, as in
regexp-match-submatch.

```scheme
   (regexp-match-submatch-start
    (regexp-search 'word "**foo**") 0)  => 2
   (regexp-match-submatch-start
    (regexp-search '(: "*" ($ word) "*") "**foo**") 0)  => 1
   (regexp-match-submatch-start
    (regexp-search '(: "*" ($ word) "*") "**foo**") 1)  => 2
```

## `(regexp-match-submatch-end regexp-match field)`

Returns the end index in regexp-match corresponding to field, as in
regexp-match-submatch.

```scheme
   (regexp-match-submatch-end
    (regexp-search 'word "**foo**") 0)  => 5
   (regexp-match-submatch-end
    (regexp-search '(: "*" ($ word) "*") "**foo**") 0)  => 6
   (regexp-match-submatch-end
    (regexp-search '(: "*" ($ word) "*") "**foo**") 1)  => 5
```

## `(regexp-match->list regexp-match)`

Returns a list of all submatches in regexp-match as string or false,
beginning with the entire match 0.

```scheme
   (regexp-match->list
    (regexp-search '(: ($ word) (+ (or space punct)) ($ word)) "cats & dogs"))
    => '("cats & dogs" "cats" "dogs")
```

## SRE Syntax

The grammar for SREs is summarized below. Note that an SRE is a
first-class object consisting of nested lists of strings, chars,
char-sets, symbols and numbers. Where the syntax is described as (foo
bar), this can be constructed equivalently as '(foo bar) or (list 'foo
'bar), etc. The following sections explain the semantics in greater
detail.

```scheme <sre> ::= | <string> ; A literal string match.  | <cset-sre>
    ; A character set match.  | (* <sre> ...)  ; 0 or more matches.  |
    (zero-or-more <sre> ...)  | (+ <sre> ...)  ; 1 or more matches.  |
    (one-or-more <sre> ...)  | (? <sre> ...)  ; 0 or 1 matches.  |
    (optional <sre> ...)  | (= <n> <sre> ...)  ; <n> matches.  |
    (exactly <n> <sre> ...)  | (>= <n> <sre> ...)  ; <n> or more
    matches.  | (at-least <n> <sre> ...)  | (** <n> <m> <sre> ...)  ;
    <n> to <m> matches.  | (repeated <n> <m> <sre> ...)

     | (|  <sre> ...)              ; Alternation.
     | (or <sre> ...)

     | (:   <sre> ...)             ; Sequence.
     | (seq <sre> ...)
     | ($ <sre> ...)               ; Numbered submatch.
     | (submatch <sre> ...)
     | (-> <name> <sre> ...)               ;  Named submatch.  <name> is
     | (submatch-named <name> <sre> ...)   ;  a symbol.

     | (w/case   <sre> ...)        ; Introduce a case-sensitive context.
     | (w/nocase <sre> ...)        ; Introduce a case-insensitive context.

     | (w/unicode   <sre> ...)     ; Introduce a unicode context.
     | (w/ascii <sre> ...)         ; Introduce an ascii context.

     | (w/nocapture <sre> ...)     ; Ignore all enclosed submatches.

     | bos                         ; Beginning of string.
     | eos                         ; End of string.

     | bol                         ; Beginning of line.
     | eol                         ; End of line.

     | bog                         ; Beginning of grapheme cluster.
     | eog                         ; End of grapheme cluster.
     | grapheme                    ; A single grapheme cluster.

     | bow                         ; Beginning of word.
     | eow                         ; End of word.
     | nwb                         ; A non-word boundary.
     | (word <sre> ...)            ; An SRE wrapped in word boundaries.
     | (word+ <cset-sre> ...)      ; A single word restricted to a cset.
     | word                        ; A single word.

     | (?? <sre> ...)              ; A non-greedy pattern, 0 or 1 match.
     | (non-greedy-optional <sre> ...)
     | (*? <sre> ...)              ; Non-greedy 0 or more matches.
     | (non-greedy-zero-or-more <sre> ...)
     | (**? <m> <n> <sre> ...)     ; Non-greedy <m> to <n> matches.
     | (non-greedy-repeated <sre> ...)
     | (look-ahead <sre> ...)      ; Zero-width look-ahead assertion.
     | (look-behind <sre> ...)     ; Zero-width look-behind assertion.
     | (neg-look-ahead <sre> ...)  ; Zero-width negative look-ahead assertion.
     | (neg-look-behind <sre> ...) ; Zero-width negative look-behind assertion.

     | (backref <n-or-name>)       ; Match a previous submatch.
```

The grammar for cset-sre is as follows.

```scheme
    <cset-sre> ::=
     | <char>                      ; literal char
     | "<char>"                    ; string of one char
     | <char-set>                  ; embedded SRFI 14 char set
     | (<string>)                  ; literal char set
     | (char-set <string>)
     | (/ <range-spec> ...)        ; ranges
     | (char-range <range-spec> ...)
     | (or <cset-sre> ...)         ; union
     | (|\|| <cset-sre> ...)
     | (and <cset-sre> ...)        ; intersection
     | (& <cset-sre> ...)
     | (- <cset-sre> ...)          ; difference
     | (- <difference> ...)
     | (~ <cset-sre> ...)          ; complement of union
     | (complement <cset-sre> ...)
     | (w/case <cset-sre> ...)     ; case and unicode toggling
     | (w/nocase <cset-sre> ...)
     | (w/ascii <cset-sre> ...)
     | (w/unicode <cset-sre> ...)
     | any | nonl | ascii | lower-case | lower
     | upper-case | upper | title-case | title
     | alphabetic | alpha | alphanumeric | alphanum | alnum
     | numeric | num | punctuation | punct | symbol
     | graphic | graph | whitespace | white | space
     | printing | print | control | cntrl | hex-digit | xdigit

    <range-spec> ::= <string> | <char>
```

## `<string>`

A literal string.

```scheme
   (regexp-search "needle" "hayneedlehay") => #<regexp-match>
   (regexp-search "needle" "haynEEdlehay") => #f
```

## `(seq sre ...)`

## `(: sre ...)`

Sequencing. Matches if each of sre matches adjacently in order.

```scheme
(regexp-search '(: "one" space "two" space "three") "one two three") => #<regexp-match>
```

## `(or sre ...)`

## `(|\|| sre ...)`

Alternation. Matches if any of sre match.

```scheme
(regexp-search '(or "eeney" "meeney" "miney") "meeney") => #<regexp-match>
(regexp-search '(or "eeney" "meeney" "miney") "moe") => #f
```

## `(w/nocase sre ...)`

Enclosed sres are case-insensitive. In a Unicode context character and
string literals match with the default simple Unicode case-insensitive
matching. Implementations may, but are not required to, handle
variable length case conversions, such as #\x00DF "ß" matching the two
characters "SS".

Character sets match if any character in the set matches
case-insensitively to the input. Conceptually each cset-sre is
expanded to contain all case variants for all of its characters. In a
compound cset-sre the expansion is applied at the terminals consisting
of characters, strings, embedded SRFI 14 char-sets, and named
character sets. For simple unions this would be equivalent to
computing the full union first and then expanding case variants, but
the semantics can differ when differences and intersections are
applied. For example, (w/nocase (~ ("Aab"))) is equivalent to (~
("AaBb")), for which "B" is clearly not a member. However if you were
to compute (~ ("Aab")) first then you would have a char-set containing
"B", and after expanding case variants both "B" and "b" would be
members.

In an ASCII context only the 52 ASCII letters (/ "a-zA-Z") match
case-insensitively to each other.

In a Unicode context the only named cset-sre which are affected by
w/nocase are upper and lower. Note that the case insensitive versions
of these are not equivalent to alpha as there are characters with the
letter property but no case.

```scheme
(regexp-search "needle" "haynEEdlehay") => #f
(regexp-search '(w/nocase "needle") "haynEEdlehay") => #<regexp-match>

(regexp-search '(~ ("Aab")) "B") => #<regexp-match>
(regexp-search '(~ ("Aab")) "b") => #f
(regexp-search '(w/nocase (~ ("Aab"))) "B") => #f
(regexp-search '(w/nocase (~ ("Aab"))) "b") => #f
(regexp-search '(~ (w/nocase ("Aab"))) "B") => #f
(regexp-search '(~ (w/nocase ("Aab"))) "b") => #f
```

## `(w/case sre ...)`

Enclosed sres are case-sensitive. This is the default, and overrides
any enclosing w/nocase setting.

```scheme
(regexp-search '(w/nocase "SMALL" (w/case "BIG")) "smallBIGsmall") => #<regexp-match>
(regexp-search '(w/nocase (~ (w/case ("Aab")))) "b") => #f
```

## `(w/ascii sre ...)`

Enclosed sres are interpreted in an ASCII context. In practice many
regular expressions are used for simple parsing and only ASCII
characters are relevant. Switching to ASCII mode can improve
performance in some implementations.

```scheme
(regexp-search '(w/ascii bos (* alpha) eos) "English") => #<regexp-match>
(regexp-search '(w/ascii bos (* alpha) eos) "Ελληνική") => #f
```

## `(w/unicode sre ...)`

Enclosed sres are interpreted in a Unicode context - character sets
with both an ASCII and Unicode definition take the latter. Has no
effect if the regexp-unicode feature is not provided. This is the
default.

```
(regexp-search '(w/unicode bos (* alpha) eos) "English") => #<regexp-match>
(regexp-search '(w/unicode bos (* alpha) eos) "Ελληνική") => #<regexp-match>
```

## `(w/nocapture sre ...)`

Disables capturing for all submatches ($, submatch, -> and
submatch-named) in the enclosed sres. The resulting SRE matches
exactly the same strings, but without any associated submatch
info. Useful for utility SREs which you want to incorporate without
affecting your submatch positions.

```scheme
   (let ((number '($ (+ digit))))
     (cdr
      (regexp-match->list
       (regexp-search `(: ,number "-" ,number "-" ,number)
                      "555-867-5309")))  ; => '("555" "867" "5309")
     (cdr
      (regexp-match->list
       (regexp-search `(: ,number "-" (w/nocapture ,number) "-" ,number)
                      "555-867-5309"))))   => '("555" "5309")
```

## `(optional sre ...)`

## `(? sre ...)`

An optional pattern - matches 1 or 0 times.

```scheme
(regexp-search '(: "match" (? "es") "!") "matches!") => #<regexp-match>
(regexp-search '(: "match" (? "es") "!") "match!") => #<regexp-match>
(regexp-search '(: "match" (? "es") "!") "matche!") => #f
```

## `(zero-or-more sre ...)`

## `(* sre ...)`

Kleene star, matches 0 or more times.

```scheme
(regexp-search '(: "<" (* (~ #\>)) ">") "<html>") => #<regexp-match>
(regexp-search '(: "<" (* (~ #\>)) ">") "<>") => #<regexp-match>
(regexp-search '(: "<" (* (~ #\>)) ">") "<html") => #f
```

## `(one-or-more sre ...)`

## `(+ sre ...)`

1 or more matches. Like * but requires at least a single match.

```scheme
(regexp-search '(: "<" (+ (~ #\>)) ">") "<html>") => #<regexp-match>
(regexp-search '(: "<" (+ (~ #\>)) ">") "<a>") => #<regexp-match>
(regexp-search '(: "<" (+ (~ #\>)) ">") "<>") => #f
```

## `(at-least n sre ...)`

## `(>= n sre ...)`

More generally, n or more matches.

```scheme
(regexp-search '(: "<" (>= 3 (~ #\>)) ">") "<table>") => #<regexp-match>
(regexp-search '(: "<" (>= 3 (~ #\>)) ">") "<pre>") => #<regexp-match>
(regexp-search '(: "<" (>= 3 (~ #\>)) ">") "<tr>") => #f
```

## `(exactly n sre ...)`

## `(= n sre ...)`

Exactly n matches.

```scheme
(regexp-search '(: "<" (= 4 (~ #\>)) ">") "<html>") => #<regexp-match>
(regexp-search '(: "<" (= 4 (~ #\>)) ">") "<table>") => #f
```

## `(repeated from to sre ...)`

## `(** from to sre ...)`

The most general form, from n to m matches, inclusive.

```scheme
(regexp-search '(: (= 3 (** 1 3 numeric) ".") (** 1 3 numeric)) "192.168.1.10") => #<regexp-match>
(regexp-search '(: (= 3 (** 1 3 numeric) ".") (** 1 3 numeric)) "192.0168.1.10") => #f
```

## `(submatch sre ...)`

## `($ sre ...)`

A numbered submatch. The contents matching the pattern will be
available in the resulting regexp-match.

## `(submatch-named name sre ...)`

## `(-> name sre ...)`

A named submatch. Behaves just like submatch, but the field may also
be referred to by name.

## `(backref n-or-name)`

Optional: Match a previously matched submatch. The feature
regexp-backrefs will be provided if this pattern is
supported. Backreferences are expensive, and can trivially be shown to
be NP-hard, so one should avoid their use even in implementations
which support them.

## `<char>`

A singleton char set.

```scheme
   (regexp-matches '(* #\-) "---") => #<regexp-match>
   (regexp-matches '(* #\-) "-_-") => #f
```

## `"<char>"`

A singleton char set written as a string of length one rather than a
character. Equivalent to its interpretation as a literal string match,
but included to clarify it can be composed in cset-sres.

## `<char-set>`

A SRFI 14 character set, which matches any character in the set. Note
that currently there is no portable written representation of SRFI 14
character sets, which means that this pattern is typically generated
programmatically, such as with a quasiquoted expression.

```
(regexp-partition `(+ ,char-set:vowels) "vowels")
   => ("v" "o" "w" "e" "ls")
```

Rationale: Many useful character sets are likely to be available as
SRFI 14 char-sets, so it is desirable to reuse them in regular
expressions. Since many Unicode character sets are extremely large,
converting back and forth between an internal and external
representation can be expensive, so the option of direct embedding is
necessary. When a readable external representation is needed,
char-set->sre can be used.

## `(char-set <string>)`

## `(<string>)`

The set of chars as formed by SRFI 14 (string->char-set <string>).

Note that char-sets contain code points, not grapheme clusters, so any
combining characters in <string> will be inserted separately from any
preceding base characters by string->char-set.

```scheme
   (regexp-matches '(* ("aeiou")) "oui") => #<regexp-match>
   (regexp-matches '(* ("aeiou")) "ouais") => #f
   (regexp-matches '(* ("e\x0301")) "e\x0301") => #<regexp-match>
   (regexp-matches '("e\x0301") "e\x0301") => #f
   (regexp-matches '("e\x0301") "e") => #<regexp-match>
   (regexp-matches '("e\x0301") "\x0301") => #<regexp-match>
   (regexp-matches '("e\x0301") "\x00E9") => #f
```

## `(char-range <range-spec> ...)`

## `(/ <range-spec> ...)`

Ranged char set. The <range-spec> is a list of strings and
characters. These are flattened and grouped into pairs of characters,
and all ranges formed by the pairs are included in the char set.

```scheme
(regexp-matches '(* (/ "AZ09")) "R2D2") => #<regexp-match>
(regexp-matches '(* (/ "AZ09")) "C-3PO") => #f
```

## `(or <cset-sre> ...)`

## `(|\|| <cset-sre> ...)`

Char set union. The single vertical bar form is provided for
consistency and compatibility with SCSH, although it needs to be
escaped in R7RS.

## `(complement <cset-sre> ...)`

## `(~ <cset-sre> ...)`

Char set complement (i.e. [^...] in PCRE notation). (~ x) is
equivalent to (- any x), thus in an ASCII context the complement is
always ASCII.

## `(difference <cset-sre> ...)`

## `(- <cset-sre> ...)`

Char set difference.

```scheme
(regexp-matches '(* (- (/ "az") ("aeiou"))) "xyzzy") => #<regexp-match>
(regexp-matches '(* (- (/ "az") ("aeiou"))) "vowels") => #f
```

## `(and <cset-sre> ...)`

## `(& <cset-sre> ...)`

Char set intersection.

```
(regexp-matches '(* (& (/ "az") (~ ("aeiou")))) "xyzzy") => #<regexp-match>
(regexp-matches '(* (& (/ "az") (~ ("aeiou")))) "vowels") => #f
```

## `any`

Match any character. Equivalent to ascii in an ASCII context.

## `nonl`

Match any character other than #\return or #\newline.

## `ascii`

Match any ASCII character [0..127].

## `lower-case`

## `lower`

Matches any character for which char-lower-case? returns true. In a
Unicode context this corresponds to the Lowercase (Ll +
Other_Lowercase) property. In an ASCII context corresponds to (/
"az").

## `upper-case`

## `upper`

Matches any character for which char-upper-case? returns true. In a
Unicode context this corresponds to the Uppercase (Lu +
Other_Uppercase) property. In an ASCII context corresponds to (/
"AZ").

## `title-case`

## `title`

Matches any character with the Unicode Titlecase (Lt) property. This
property only exists for the sake of ligature characters, of which
only 31 exist at time of writing. In an ASCII context this is empty.

## `alphabetic`

## `alpha`

Matches any character for which char-alphabetic? returns true. In a
Unicode context this corresponds to the Alphabetic (L + Nl +
Other_Alphabetic) property. In an ASCII context corresponds to
(w/nocase (/ "az")).

## `numeric`

## `num`

Matches any character for which char-numeric? returns true. For In a
Unicode context this corresponds to the Numeric_Digit (Nd)
property. In an ASCII context corresponds to (/ "09").

## `alphanumeric`

## `alphanum`

## `alnum`

Matches any character which is either a letter or number. Equivalent
to:

```scheme
   (or alphabetic numeric)
```

## `punctuation`

## `punct`

Matches any punctuation character. In a Unicode context this
corresponds to the Punctuation property (P). In an ASCII context this
corresponds to "!\"#%&'()*,-./:;?@[\]_{}".

## `symbol`

Matches any symbol character. In a Unicode context this corresponds to
the Symbol property (Sm, Sc, Sk, or So). In an ASCII this corresponds
to "$+<=>^`|~".

## `graphic`

## `graph`

Matches any graphic character. Equivalent to:

```scheme
   (or alphanumeric punctuation symbol)
```

## `whitespace`

## `white`

## `space`

Matches any whitespace character. In a Unicode context this
corresponds to the Separator property (Zs, Zl or Zp). In an ASCII
context this corresponds to space, tab, line feed, form feed, and
carriage return.

## `printing`

## `print`

Matches any printing character. Equivalent to:

```scheme
   (or graphic whitespace)
```

## `control`

## `cntrl`

Matches any control or other character. In a Unicode context this
corresponds to the Other property (Cc, Cf, Co, Cs or Cn). In an ASCII
context this corresponds to:

```scheme
   `(/ ,(integer->char 0) ,(integer-char 31))
```

## `hex-digit`

## `xdigit`

Matches any valid digit in hexadecimal notation. Always
ASCII-only. Equivalent to:

```scheme
(w/ascii (w/nocase (or numeric "abcdef")))
```

## `bos`

## `eos`

Matches at the beginning/end of string without consuming any
characters (a zero-width assertion). If the search was initiated with
start/end parameters, these are considered the end points, rather than
the full string.

## `bol`

## `eol`

Matches at the beginning/end of a line without consuming any
characters (a zero-width assertion). A line is a possibly empty
sequence of characters followed by an end of line sequence as
understood by the R7RS read-line procedure, specifically any of a
linefeed character, carriage return character, or a carriage return
followed by a linefeed character. The string is assumed to contain end
of line sequences before the start and after the end of the string,
even if the search was made on a substring and the actual surrounding
characters differ.

## `bow`

## `eow`

Matches at the beginning/end of a word without consuming any
characters (a zero-width assertion). A word is a contiguous sequence
of characters that are either alphanumeric or the underscore
character, i.e. (or alphanumeric "_"), with the definition of
alphanumeric depending on the Unicode or ASCII context. The string is
assumed to contain non-word characters immediately before the start
and after the end, even if the search was made on a substring and word
constituent characters appear immediately before the beginning or
after the end.

```scheme
  (regexp-search '(: bow "foo") "foo") => #<regexp-match>
  (regexp-search '(: bow "foo") "<foo>>") => #<regexp-match>
  (regexp-search '(: bow "foo") "snafoo") => #f
  (regexp-search '(: "foo" eow) "foo") => #<regexp-match>
  (regexp-search '(: "foo" eow) "foo!") => #<regexp-match>
  (regexp-search '(: "foo" eow) "foobar") => #f
```

## `nwb`

Matches a non-word-boundary (i.e. \B in PCRE). Equivalent to
(neg-look-ahead (or bow eow)).

## `(word sre ...)`

Anchors a sequence to word boundaries. Equivalent to:

```scheme
   (: bow sre ... eow)
```

## `(word+ cset-sre ...)`

Matches a single word composed of characters in the intersection of
the given cset-sre and the word constituent characters. Equivalent to:

```scheme
   (word (+ (and (or alphanumeric "_") (or cset-sre ...))))
```

## `word`

A shorthand for (word+ any).

## `bog`

## `eog`

Matches at the beginning/end of a single extended grapheme cluster
without consuming any characters (a zero-width assertion). Grapheme
cluster boundaries are defined in Unicode TR29. The string is assumed
to contain non-combining codepoints immediately before the start and
after the end. These always succeed in an ASCII context.

## `grapheme`

Matches a single grapheme cluster (i.e. \X in PCRE). This is what the
end-user typically thinks of as a single character, comprised of a
base non-combining codepoint followed by zero or more combining
marks. In an ASCII context this is equivalent to any.

Assuming char-set:mark contains all characters with the Extend or
SpacingMark properties defined in TR29, and char-set:control,
char-set:regional-indicator and char-set:hangul-* are defined
similarly, then the following SRE can be used with regexp-extract to
define grapheme:

```scheme
   `(or (: (* ,char-set:hangul-l) (+ ,char-set:hangul-v)
           (* ,char-set:hangul-t))
        (: (* ,char-set:hangul-l) ,char-set:hangul-v
           (* ,char-set:hangul-v) (* ,char-set:hangul-t))
        (: (* ,char-set:hangul-l) ,char-set:hangul-lvt
           (* ,char-set:hangul-t))
        (+ ,char-set:hangul-l)
        (+ ,char-set:hangul-t)
        (+ ,char-set:regional-indicator)
        (: "\r\n")
        (: (~ control ("\r\n"))
           (* ,char-set:mark))
        control)
```

## `(non-greedy-optional sre ...)`

## `(?? sre ...)`

Non-greedy pattern, matches 0 or 1 times, preferring the shorter
match.

## `(non-greedy-zero-or-more< sre ...)`

## `(*? sre ...)`

Non-greedy Kleene star, matches 0 or more times, preferring the
shorter match.

## `(non-greedy-repeated m n sre ...)`

## `(**? m n sre ...)`

Non-greedy Kleene star, matches m to n times, preferring the shorter
match.

## `(look-ahead sre ...)`

Zero-width look-ahead assertion. Asserts the sequence matches from the
current position, without advancing the position.

```scheme
(regexp-matches '(: "regular" (look-ahead " expression") " expression") "regular expression")=> #<regexp-match>
(regexp-matches '(: "regular" (look-ahead " ") "expression") "regular expression")=> #f
```

## `(look-behind sre ...)`

Zero-width look-behind assertion. Asserts the sequence matches behind
the current position, without advancing the position. It is an error
if the sequence does not have a fixed length.

## `(neg-look-ahead sre ...)`

Zero-width negative look-ahead assertion.

## `(neg-look-behind sre ...)`

Zero-width negative look-behind assertion.
