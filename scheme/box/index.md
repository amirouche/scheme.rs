# `(scheme box)`

This library is based on [SRFI-111](https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-111/).


Boxes are objects with a single mutable state. Several Schemes have
them, sometimes called cells. A constructor, predicate, accessor, and
mutator are provided.

## `(box value)`

Constructor. Returns a newly allocated box initialized to value.

## `(box? object)`

Predicate. Returns `#t` if object is a box, and `#f` otherwise.

## `(unbox box)`

Accessor. Returns the current value of box.

## `(set-box! box value)`

Mutator. Changes box to hold value.
