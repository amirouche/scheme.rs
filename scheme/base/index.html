<p>There is two uses of <code>begin</code>.</p>
<h3><code>(begin expression-or-definition ...)</code></h3>
<p>This form of begin can appear as part of a body, or at the outermost

construct were not present.</p>
<p>TODO: example</p>
<h3><code>(begin expression1 expression2 ...)</code></h3>
<p>This form of begin can be used as an ordinary expression. The
expressions are evaluated sequentially from left to right, and the
values of the last expression are returned. This expression type is
used to sequence side effects such as assignments or input and output.</p>

temporary bytevector and then into the destination.  This can be
achieved without allocating storage by making sure to copy in the
correct direction in such circumstances.</p>

<h2><code>(call-with-current-continuation proc)</code></h2>
<p>It is an error if proc does not accept one argument.</p>
<p>The procedure call-with-current-continuation (or its equivalent
abbreviation call/cc) packages the current continuation (see the
rationale below) as an “escape procedure” and passes it as an argument
to proc. The escape procedure is a Scheme procedure that, if it is
later called, will abandon whatever continuation is in effect at that
later time and will instead use the continuation that was in effect
when the escape procedure was created. Calling the escape procedure
will cause the invocation of before and after thunks installed using
dynamic-wind.</p>
<p>The escape procedure accepts the same number of arguments as the
continuation to the original call to
call-with-current-continuation. Most continuations take only one
value. Continuations created by the call-with-values procedure
(including the initialization expressions of define-values,
let-values, and let<em>-values expressions), take the number of values
that the consumer expects. The continuations of all non-final
expressions within a sequence of expressions, such as in lambda,
case-lambda, begin, let, let</em>, letrec, letrec<em>, let-values,
let</em>-values, let-syntax, letrec-syntax, parameterize, guard, case,
cond, when, and unless expressions, take an arbitrary number of values
because they discard the values passed to them in any event. The
effect of passing no values or more than one value to continuations
that were not created in one of these ways is unspecified.</p>
<p>The escape procedure that is passed to proc has unlimited extent just
like any other procedure in Scheme. It can be stored in variables or
data structures and can be called as many times as desired. However,
like the raise and error procedures, it never returns to its caller.</p>
<p>TODO: example</p>
<h2><code>(call-with-port port proc)</code></h2>
<p>The <code>call-with-port</code> procedure calls <code>PROC</code> with <code>PORT</code> as an
argument.  If <code>PROC</code> returns, then the <code>PORT</code> is closed automatically
and the values yielded by the <code>PROC</code> are returned. If <code>PROC</code> does not
return, then the <code>PORT</code> must not be closed automatically unless it is
possible to prove that the port will never again be used for a read or
write operation.</p>
<p>It is an error if <code>PROC</code> does not accept one argument.</p>
<h2><code>(call-with-values producer consumer)</code></h2>
<p>Calls its producer argument with no arguments and a continuation that,
when passed some values, calls the consumer procedure with those
values as arguments.  The continuation for the call to consumer is the
continuation of the call to <code>call-with-values</code>.</p>
<h2><code>(call/cc proc)</code></h2>
<p>Abbreviation for <code>call-with-continuation</code>.</p>
<h2><code>(car pair)</code></h2>
<p>Returns the contents of the car field of pair.  Note that it is an

error to take the <code>cdr</code> of the empty list.</p>
<h2><code>(ceiling x)</code></h2>
<p>The ceiling procedure returns the smallest integer not smaller than x.</p>
<h2><code>(char-&gt;integer char)</code></h2>
<p>Given a Unicode character, <code>char-&gt;integer</code> returns an exact integer
between 0 and #xD7FF or between #xE000 and #x10FFFF which is equal to
the Unicode scalar value of that character. Given a non-Unicode
character, it returns an exact integer greater than #x10FFFF.</p>
<h2><code>(char-ready? [port])</code></h2>
<p>Returns #t if a character is ready on the textual input port and
returns #f otherwise. If char-ready returns #t then the next read-char
operation on the given port is guaranteed not to hang. If the port is
at end of file then char-ready? returns #t.</p>

<h2><code>(eof-object)</code></h2>
<p>Returns an end-of-file object, not necessarily unique.</p>
<h2><code>(eof-object? obj)</code></h2>
<p>Returns #t if obj is an end-of-file object, otherwise returns #f. A
end-of-file object will ever be an object that can be read in using
read.</p>
<h2><code>(eq? obj1 obj2)</code></h2>
<p>The eq? procedure is similar to eqv? except that in some cases it is
capable of discerning distinctions finer than those detectable by
eqv?. It must always return #f when eqv? also would, but may return #f
in some cases where eqv? would return #t.</p>
<p>On symbols, booleans, the empty list, pairs, and records, and also on
non-empty strings, vectors, and bytevectors, eq? and eqv? are
guaranteed to have the same behavior. On procedures, eq? must return
true if the arguments’ location tags are equal. On numbers and
characters, eq?’s behavior is implementation-dependent, but it will
always return either true or false. On empty strings, empty vectors,
and empty bytevectors, eq? may also behave differently from eqv?.</p>
<h2><code>(equal? obj1 obj2)</code></h2>
<p>The equal? procedure, when applied to pairs, vectors, strings and
bytevectors, recursively compares them, returning #t when the
unfoldings of its arguments into (possibly infinite) trees are equal
(in the sense of equal?) as ordered trees, and #f otherwise. It
returns the same as eqv? when applied to booleans, symbols, numbers,
characters, ports, procedures, and the empty list. If two objects are
eqv?, they must be equal? as well. In all other cases, equal? may
return either #t or #f.</p>
<p>Even if its arguments are circular data structures, equal? must always
terminate.</p>
<h2><code>(eqv? obj1 obj2)</code></h2>
<p>The eqv? procedure defines a useful equivalence relation on
objects. Briefly, it returns #t if obj1 and obj2 are normally regarded
as the same object.</p>
<p>TODO: complete based on r7rs small and guile.</p>
<h2><code>(error [who] message . irritants)</code></h2>
<p>Raises an exception as if by calling raise on a newly allocated
implementation-defined object which encapsulates the information
provided by message, as well as any objs, known as the irritants. The
procedure error-object? must return #t on such objects.</p>
<h2><code>(error-object-irritants error)</code></h2>
<p>Returns a list of the irritants encapsulated by error.</p>
<h2><code>(error-object-message error)</code></h2>
<p>Returns the message encapsulated by error.</p>
<h2><code>(error-object? obj)</code></h2>
<p>Returns #t if obj is an object created by <code>error</code> or one of an
implementation-defined set of objects. Otherwise, it returns #f. The
objects used to signal errors, including those which satisfy the
predicates <code>file-error?</code> and <code>read-error?</code>, may or may not satisfy
<code>error-object?</code>.</p>
<h2><code>(even? number)</code></h2>
<p>Return <code>#t</code> if <code>NUMBER</code> is even. Otherwise <code>#f</code>.</p>
<h2><code>(exact z)</code></h2>
<p>TODO: FIXME</p>
<p>The procedure exact returns an exact representation of z. The value
returned is the exact number that is numerically closest to the
argument. For exact arguments, the result is the same as the
argument. For inexact non-integral real arguments, the implementation
may return a rational approximation, or may report an implementation
violation. For inexact complex arguments, the result is a complex
number whose real and imaginary parts are the result of applying exact
to the real and imaginary parts of the argument, respectively. If an
inexact argument has no reasonably close exact equivalent, (in the
sense of <code>=</code>), then a violation of an implementation restriction may
be reported.</p>
<h2><code>(exact-integer-sqrt k)</code></h2>

<h2><code>(for-each proc list1 ...)</code></h2>
<p>It is an error if proc does not accept as many arguments as there are
lists.</p>
<p>The arguments to for-each are like the arguments to map, but for-each
calls proc for its side effects rather than for its values. Unlike
map, for-each is guaranteed to call proc on the elements of the lists
in order from the first element(s) to the last, and the value returned
by for-each is unspecified. If more than one list is given and not all
lists have the same length, for-each terminates when the shortest list
runs out. The lists can be circular, but it is an error if all of them
are circular.</p>
<h2><code>(gcd n1 ...)</code></h2>
<p>Return the greatest common divisor.</p>
<h2><code>(get-output-bytevector port)</code></h2>
<p>It is an error if port was not created with <code>open-output-bytevector</code>.</p>

<h2><code>(inexact z)</code></h2>
<p>The procedure inexact returns an inexact representation of z. The
value returned is the inexact number that is numerically closest to
the argument. For inexact arguments, the result is the same as the
argument. For exact complex numbers, the result is a complex number
whose real and imaginary parts are the result of applying inexact to
the real and imaginary parts of the argument, respectively. If an
exact argument has no reasonably close inexact equivalent (in the
sense of <code>=</code>), then a violation of an implementation restriction may
be reported.</p>
<h2><code>(inexact? z)</code></h2>
<p>Return <code>#t</code> if <code>Z</code> is inexact. Otherwise <code>#f</code>.</p>
<h2><code>(input-port-open? port)</code></h2>
<p>Returns #t if port is still open and capable of performing input, and
<code>#f</code> otherwise.</p>

<h2><code>(list-&gt;string list)</code></h2>
<p>It is an error if any element of list is not a character.</p>
<p>list-&gt;string returns a newly allocated string formed from the elements
in the list list.</p>
<h2><code>(list-&gt;vector list)</code></h2>
<p>The list-&gt;vector procedure returns a newly created vector initialized
to the elements of the list list.</p>
<h2><code>(list-copy obj)</code></h2>
<p>Returns a newly allocated copy of the given obj if it is a list. Only
the pairs themselves are copied; the cars of the result are the same
(in the sense of eqv?) as the cars of list. If obj is an improper
list, so is the result, and the final cdrs are the same in the sense
of eqv?. An obj which is not a list is returned unchanged. It is an
error if obj is a circular list.</p>
<h2><code>(list-ref list k)</code></h2>
<p>The list argument can be circular, but it is an error if list has
fewer than k elements.</p>
<p>Returns the kth element of list. (This is the same as the car of
(list-tail list k).)</p>
<h2><code>(list-set! list k obj)</code></h2>
<p>It is an error if k is not a valid index of list.</p>
<p>The list-set! procedure stores obj in element k of list.</p>
<h2><code>(list-tail list k)</code></h2>
<p>It is an error if list has fewer than k elements.</p>
<p>Returns the sublist of list obtained by omitting the first k elements.</p>
<h2><code>(list? obj)</code></h2>
<p>Return <code>#t</code> if <code>OBJ</code> is a list. Otherwise <code>#f</code>.</p>
<h2><code>(make-bytevector k [byte])</code></h2>
<p>The make-bytevector procedure returns a newly allocated bytevector of
length k. If byte is given, then all elements of the bytevector are
initialized to byte, otherwise the contents of each element are
unspecified.</p>
<h2><code>(make-list k [fill])</code></h2>
<p>Returns a newly allocated list of k elements. If a second argument is
given, then each element is initialized to fill. Otherwise the initial
contents of each element is unspecified.</p>
<h2><code>(make-parameter init [converter])</code></h2>
<p>Returns a newly allocated parameter object, which is a procedure that
accepts zero arguments and returns the value associated with the
parameter object. Initially, this value is the value of (converter
init), or of init if the conversion procedure converter is not
specified. The associated value can be temporarily changed using
parameterize, which is described below.</p>
<h2><code>(make-string k [char])</code></h2>
<p>The make-string procedure returns a newly allocated string of length
k. If char is given, then all the characters of the string are
initialized to char, otherwise the contents of the string are

initial contents of each element is unspecified.</p>
<h2><code>(map proc list1 ...)</code></h2>
<p>It is an error if proc does not accept as many arguments as there are
lists and return a single value.</p>
<p>The map procedure applies proc element-wise to the elements of the
lists and returns a list of the results, in order. If more than one
list is given and not all lists have the same length, map terminates
when the shortest list runs out. The lists can be circular, but it is
an error if all of them are circular. It is an error for proc to
mutate any of the lists. The dynamic order in which proc is applied to
the elements of the lists is unspecified. If multiple returns occur
from map, the values returned by earlier returns are not mutated.</p>
<h2><code>(max x1 ...)</code></h2>
<p>Return the maximum of its arguments.</p>
<h2><code>(member obj list [compare])</code></h2>
<p>Return the first sublist of list whose <code>car</code> is <code>obj</code>, where the

retrieval by <code>get-output-string</code>.</p>
<h2><code>(or test1 ...)</code> syntax</h2>
<p>The <code>test</code> expressions are evaluated from left to right, and the value
of the first expression that evaluates to a true value is
returned. Any remaining expressions are not evaluated. If all

specified parameter objects during the evaluation of the body.</p>
<p>The param and value expressions are evaluated in an unspecified
order. The body is evaluated in a dynamic environment in which calls
to the parameters return the results of passing the corresponding
values to the conversion procedure specified when the parameters were
created. Then the previous values of the parameters are restored
without passing them to the conversion procedure. The results of the
last expression in the body are returned as the results of the entire
parameterize expression.</p>
<p>Note: If the conversion procedure is not idempotent, the results of
(parameterize ((x (x))) ...), which appears to bind the parameter x to
its current value, might not be what the user expects.</p>
<p>If an implementation supports multiple threads of execution, then
parameterize must not change the associated values of any parameters
in any thread other than the current thread and threads created inside
body.</p>
<p>Parameter objects can be used to specify configurable settings for a
computation without the need to pass the value to every procedure in
the call chain explicitly.</p>
<h2><code>(peek-char [port])</code></h2>
<p>Returns the next character available from the textual input port, but
without updating the port to point to the following character. If no
more characters are available, an end-of-file object is returned.</p>
<p>Note: The value returned by a call to peek-char is the same as the
value that would have been returned by a call to read-char with the
same port. The only difference is that the very next call to read-char
or peek-char on that port will return the value returned by the
preceding call to peek-char. In particular, a call to peek-char on an
interactive port will hang waiting for input whenever a call to
read-char would have hung.</p>
<h2><code>(peek-u8 [port])</code></h2>
<p>Returns the next byte available from the binary input port, but
without updating the port to point to the following byte. If no more
bytes are available, an end-of-file object is returned.</p>
<h2><code>(port? obj)</code></h2>
<p>Return <code>#t</code> if <code>OBJ</code> is port. Otherwise <code>#f</code>.</p>
<h2><code>(positive? x)</code></h2>
<p>Return <code>#t</code> if <code>X</code> is positive. Otherwise <code>#f</code>.</p>
<h2><code>(procedure? obj)</code></h2>
<p>Return <code>#t</code> if <code>OBJ</code> is a procedure. Otherwise <code>#f</code>.</p>
<h2><code>quasiquote</code></h2>

<h2><code>quote</code></h2>
<p>TODO</p>
<h2><code>quotient</code></h2>
<p>TODO</p>
<h2><code>(raise obj)</code></h2>
<p>Raises an exception by invoking the current exception handler on
obj. The handler is called with the same dynamic environment as that
of the call to raise, except that the current exception handler is the
one that was in place when the handler being called was installed. If
the handler returns, a secondary exception is raised in the same
dynamic environment as the handler. The relationship between obj and
the object raised by the secondary exception is unspecified.</p>
<h2><code>(raise-continuable obj)</code></h2>
<p>Raises an exception by invoking the current exception handler on
obj. The handler is called with the same dynamic environment as the
call to raise-continuable, except that: (1) the current exception
handler is the one that was in place when the handler being called was
installed, and (2) if the handler being called returns, then it will
again become the current exception handler. If the handler returns,
the values it returns become the values returned by the call to
raise-continuable.</p>
<h2><code>(rational? obj)</code></h2>
<p>Return <code>#t</code> if <code>OBJ</code> is a rational number. Otherwise <code>#f</code>.</p>
<h2><code>(rationalize x y)</code></h2>
<p>The rationalize procedure returns the simplest rational number
differing from x by no more than y.</p>
<h2><code>(read-bytevector k [port])</code></h2>
<p>Reads the next k bytes, or as many as are available before the end of
file, from the binary input port into a newly allocated bytevector in
left-to-right order and returns the bytevector. If no bytes are
available before the end of file, an end-of-file object is returned.</p>
<h2><code>(read-bytevector! bytevector [port [start [end]]])</code></h2>
<p>Reads the next end - start bytes, or as many as are available before
the end of file, from the binary input port into bytevector in
left-to-right order beginning at the start position. If end is not
supplied, reads until the end of bytevector has been reached. If start
is not supplied, reads beginning at position 0. Returns the number of
bytes read. If no bytes are available, an end-of-file object is
returned.</p>
<h2><code>(read-char [port])</code></h2>
<p>Returns the next character available from the textual input port,
updating the port to point to the following character. If no more
characters are available, an end-of-file object is returned.</p>
<h2><code>(read-error? obj)</code></h2>
<p>Error type predicates. Returns #t if obj is an object raised by the
read procedure. Otherwise, it returns #f.</p>
<h2><code>(read-line [port])</code></h2>
<p>Returns the next line of text available from the textual input port,
updating the port to point to the following character. If an end of
line is read, a string containing all of the text up to (but not
including) the end of line is returned, and the port is updated to
point just past the end of line. If an end of file is encountered
before any end of line is read, but some characters have been read, a
string containing those characters is returned. If an end of file is
encountered before any characters are read, an end-of-file object is
returned. For the purpose of this procedure, an end of line consists
of either a linefeed character, a carriage return character, or a
sequence of a carriage return character followed by a linefeed
character. Implementations may also recognize other end of line
characters or sequences.</p>
<h2><code>(read-string k [port])</code></h2>
<p>Reads the next k characters, or as many as are available before the
end of file, from the textual input port into a newly allocated string
in left-to-right order and returns the string. If no characters are
available before the end of file, an end-of-file object is returned.</p>
<h2><code>(read-u8 [port])</code></h2>
<p>Returns the next byte available from the binary input port, updating
the port to point to the following byte. If no more bytes are
available, an end-of-file object is returned.</p>
<h2><code>(real? obj)</code></h2>
<p>Return #t if <code>OBJ</code> is real number. Otherwise <code>#f</code>.</p>
<h2><code>(remainder n1 n2)</code></h2>

reverse order.</p>
<h2><code>(round x)</code></h2>
<p>TODO</p>
<h2><code>(set! &lt;variable&gt; &lt;expression&gt;)</code> syntax</h2>
<p>Expression is evaluated, and the resulting value is stored in the
location to which variable is bound. It is an error if variable is not
bound either in some region enclosing the set! expression or else
globally. The result of the set! expression is unspecified.</p>
<h2><code>(set-car! pair obj)</code></h2>
<p>Stores <code>obj</code> in the car field of <code>pair</code>.</p>

analogous to list.</p>
<h2><code>(string-&gt;list string [start [end]])</code></h2>
<p>The string-&gt;list procedure returns a newly allocated list of the
characters of string between start and end.</p>
<h2><code>(string-&gt;number string [radix])</code></h2>
<p>Returns a number of the maximally precise representation expressed by
the given string. It is an error if radix is not 2, 8, 10, or 16.</p>
<p>If supplied, radix is a default radix that will be overridden if an
explicit radix prefix is present in string (e.g. "#o177"). If radix is
not supplied, then the default radix is 10. If string is not a
syntactically valid notation for a number, or would result in a number
that the implementation cannot represent, then string-&gt;number returns</p>
<h1>f. An error is never signaled due to the content of string.</h1>
<h2><code>(string-&gt;symbol string)</code></h2>
<p>Returns the symbol whose name is string. This procedure can create
symbols with names containing special characters that would require
escaping when written, but does not interpret escapes in its input.</p>
<h2><code>(string-&gt;utf8 string [start [end]])</code></h2>
<p>The string-&gt;utf8 procedure encodes the characters of a string between
start and end and returns the corresponding bytevector.</p>
<h2><code>(string-&gt;vector string [start [end]])</code></h2>
<p>The string-&gt;vector procedure returns a newly created vector
initialized to the elements of the string string between start and
end.</p>
<h2><code>(string-append string ...)</code></h2>
<p>Returns a newly allocated string whose characters are the
concatenation of the characters in the given strings.</p>
<h2><code>(string-copy string [start [end]])</code></h2>
<p>Returns a newly allocated copy of the part of the given string between
start and end.</p>
<h2><code>(string-copy! to at from [start [end]])</code></h2>
<p>It is an error if at is less than zero or greater than the length of
to. It is also an error if (- (string-length to) at) is less than (-
end start).</p>
<p>Copies the characters of string from between start and end to string
to, starting at at. The order in which characters are copied is
unspecified, except that if the source and destination overlap,
copying takes place as if the source is first copied into a temporary
string and then into the destination. This can be achieved without
allocating storage by making sure to copy in the correct direction in
such circumstances.</p>
<h2><code>(string-fill! string fill [start [end]])</code></h2>
<p>It is an error if fill is not a character.</p>
<p>The string-fill! procedure stores fill in the elements of string
between start and end.</p>
<h2><code>(string-for-each proc string1 ...)</code></h2>
<p>It is an error if proc does not accept as many arguments as there are
strings.</p>
<p>The arguments to string-for-each are like the arguments to string-map,
but string-for-each calls proc for its side effects rather than for
its values. Unlike string-map, string-for-each is guaranteed to call
proc on the elements of the lists in order from the first element(s)
to the last, and the value returned by string-for-each is
unspecified. If more than one string is given and not all strings have
the same length, string-for-each terminates when the shortest string
runs out. It is an error for proc to mutate any of the strings.</p>
<h2><code>(string-length string)</code></h2>
<p>Returns the number of characters in the given string.</p>
<h2><code>(string-map proc string1 ...)</code></h2>
<p>It is an error if proc does not accept as many arguments as there are
strings and return a single character.</p>
<p>The string-map procedure applies proc element-wise to the elements of
the strings and returns a string of the results, in order. If more
than one string is given and not all strings have the same length,
string-map terminates when the shortest string runs out. The dynamic
order in which proc is applied to the elements of the strings is
unspecified. If multiple returns occur from string-map, the values
returned by earlier returns are not mutated.</p>
<h2><code>(string-ref string k)</code></h2>
<p>It is an error if k is not a valid index of string.</p>
<p>The string-ref procedure returns character k of string using
zero-origin indexing. There is no requirement for this procedure to
execute in constant time.</p>
<h2><code>(string-set! string k char)</code></h2>
<p>It is an error if k is not a valid index of string.</p>
<p>The string-set! procedure stores char in element k of string. There is
no requirement for this procedure to execute in constant time.</p>

<h2><code>(string? obj)</code></h2>
<p>Return <code>#t</code> if <code>OBJ</code> is string. Otherwise <code>#f</code>.</p>
<h2><code>(substring string start end)</code></h2>
<p>The substring procedure returns a newly allocated string formed from
the characters of string beginning with index start and ending with
index end. This is equivalent to calling string-copy with the same
arguments, but is provided for backward compatibility and stylistic
flexibility.</p>
<h2><code>(symbol-&gt;string symbol)</code></h2>
<p>Returns the name of symbol as a string, but without adding escapes. It
is an error to apply mutation procedures like string-set! to strings
returned by this procedure.</p>
<h2><code>(symbol=? symbol1 symbol2 ...)</code></h2>
<p>Returns #t if all the arguments are symbols and all have the same
names in the sense of string=?.</p>

<p>Returns #t if a byte is ready on the binary input port and returns #f
otherwise. If u8-ready? returns #t then the next read-u8 operation on

the sense of eqv?) as the elements of the old.</p>
<h2><code>(vector-copy! to at from [start [end]])</code></h2>
<p>It is an error if at is less than zero or greater than the length of
to. It is also an error if (- (vector-length to) at) is less than (-
end start).</p>
<p>Copies the elements of vector from between start and end to vector to,
starting at at. The order in which elements are copied is unspecified,
